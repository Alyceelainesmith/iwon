<p>My life was great except for not having enough money.  I was living from paycheck to paycheck and actually never making it to the next check!  My dream was this:  pay off all my debt, pay off all my parents debts, pay off all my son's debts start my own business</p>
<p>Then I played the lotto and WON!  Now I need to study on how to make the money make money. <b>I am exited and ready to make a mark on this world</b> I am excited!</p>
